Conway's Game Of Life
---
It is a cellular automaton governed by 4 simple rules.  

1. A cell with less than *2* live neighbors will die as if through underpopulation
2. A cell with more than *3* live neighbors will die as if through overpopulation
3. A cell with *2* or *3* live neighbors will survive onto the next generations
4. A dead cell with **exactly** *3* live neighbors will become live in the next generation as if through reproduction

Following these simple rules, we can see an infinite simulation take place.
